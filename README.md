Transform your audio files into accurate text transcriptions with our AI-powered web application. Built for the **Cerebras x Cline Hackathon** showcasing the power of AI-assisted development.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üéØ Drag & Drop Interface** - Simply drag audio files onto the upload area
- **‚ö° Real-time Processing** - Watch your transcription progress in real-time
- **üìù Smart Transcription** - Powered by Deepgram's Nova-3 model with:
  - Automatic language detection
  - Speaker diarization
  - Smart formatting
- **üíæ Download Results** - Get your transcription as a .txt file
- **üì± Responsive Design** - Beautiful dark theme that works on all devices
- **üîÑ Async Processing** - Handle large audio files without timeouts

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Deepgram API key ([Get yours here](https://deepgram.com))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benschiller/vibescribe.git
   cd vibescribe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env file with your keys
   echo "DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here" > .env
   echo "PORT=3000" >> .env
   echo "PUBLIC_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app" >> .env
   ```

4. **Set up ngrok for webhooks** (Required for Deepgram callbacks)
   ```bash
   # Install ngrok globally if you haven't already
   npm install -g ngrok
   
   # In a separate terminal, expose your local server
   ngrok http 3000
   
   # Copy the https URL and update your .env PUBLIC_URL
   ```

5. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üîß Environment Configuration

**Important**: PUBLIC_URL is required for Deepgram webhooks, even in development.

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here
PORT=3000
PUBLIC_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
```

### Development Setup
- **Use ngrok** for webhook development: `ngrok http 3000`
- **Set PUBLIC_URL** to your ngrok HTTPS URL in the `.env` file
- **Restart server** after updating PUBLIC_URL for changes to take effect

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (`server.js`)
- **Express.js** server with file upload handling
- **Multer** for multipart form data processing  
- **Deepgram SDK** for speech-to-text transcription
- **Async webhook processing** for handling large files
- **In-memory storage** for stateless deployment

### Frontend (`public/`)
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for maximum performance
- **Drag & drop** file upload interface
- **Real-time polling** for transcription status
- **Responsive CSS** with glassmorphism design
- **Progressive enhancement** for better UX

### Key Features Implementation

#### üéØ Async Processing Flow
1. File uploaded via drag & drop or file picker
2. Server validates and forwards to Deepgram API
3. Webhook receives transcription results
4. Client polls for completion status
5. Results displayed in dedicated transcript page

#### üîí Security Features
- File type validation (audio files only)
- Environment variable configuration
- Memory-only file storage
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` patterns

## üìã Supported Audio Formats

- **MP3** - Most common format
- **WAV** - Uncompressed audio
- **FLAC** - Lossless compression
- **M4A** - Apple format
- **AAC** - Advanced Audio Coding
- **OGG** - Open source format
- **WEBM** - Web audio format

## üéØ Hackathon Story

This project was **entirely built using AI assistance** as part of the Cerebras x Cline Hackathon:

### ü§ñ AI Development Process
- **Qwen3 Coder** provided architectural guidance and code generation
- **Cline** coding agent with direct access to frontier models
- **AI pair programming** for rapid prototyping and feature development

### üèÜ Technical Achievements
- **Zero-to-deployment** in minimal time using AI assistance
- **Production-ready** architecture with async processing
- **Responsive UI/UX** designed and implemented with AI guidance
- **Security-first** approach with comprehensive review

### üí° Innovation Highlights
- **Webhook-based processing** for handling large audio files
- **Real-time status updates** with elegant loading states
- **Glassmorphism design** for modern visual appeal

## üôè Acknowledgments

- **Cerebras** for hosting the hackathon
- **Cline** for the collaboration platform  
- **Qwen3 Coder** for AI development assistance
- **Deepgram** for world-class speech-to-text API
